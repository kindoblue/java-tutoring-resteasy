A Java-based office management system that provides a RESTful API for managing office spaces, employees, and seat assignments. The system allows you to:
- Create and manage multiple floors with rooms
- Track and assign seats to employees
- Search employees with pagination and filtering
- Monitor office space utilization

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- VSCode Extension: [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Open VSCode
3. Install the "Dev Containers" extension if you haven't already
4. Open the project folder in VSCode
5. When prompted "Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container?" click "Reopen in Container"

VSCode will then:
1. Build and start two containers:
   - A development container with all necessary tools (Java, Maven, etc.)
   - A PostgreSQL database container (accessible on port 5432)
2. Mount your project files into the development container
3. Connect VSCode to the development container

## Development Container Details

The project uses VSCode's Dev Containers feature to provide a consistent development environment. The setup includes:

1. **Development Container**:
   - Based on devbox image
   - Contains all development tools (Java 11, Maven, etc.)
   - Mounts your project directory
   - Connected to the database container
   - Configured with necessary extensions for Java development

2. **Database Container**:
   - PostgreSQL 15
   - Persists data in a Docker volume
   - Automatically initialized with schema
   - Health checks ensure database is ready before app starts

## Database Setup

The PostgreSQL database is automatically:
- Created with name: `office_management`
- Initialized with tables: `floors`, `office_rooms`, and `seats`
- Populated with sample data
- Accessible with:
  - Host: `localhost`
  - Port: `5432`
  - Username: `postgres`
  - Password: `postgres`

## Building and Running

### Building
Build the project, run tests and create WAR file:

```bash
mvn package
```

This will:
1. Compile the Java code
2. Run all tests
3. Package the application into a WAR file

### Running
Start the application using the embedded Tomcat server:

```bash
mvn cargo:run
```

This will:
1. Start an embedded Tomcat server
2. Deploy the WAR file to Tomcat
3. Make the application available at `http://localhost:8080`
